# About

I am a software engineering leader with over 10 years of experience in the banking and government sectors. I am currently the Director of Information Technology for a court within the federal judiciary of the United States, where I lead a team of engineers in bringing digital transformation to the administration of justice. I am also the founder of the Federal Courts Software Factory, a centralized development and deployment environment that uses automation and standardized processes to produce software applications.

I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in literate programming, declarative configuration, and container orchestration. I have a proven track record of success in leading and delivering complex software projects.

Apart from work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family and friends. Other interests include music, astronomy, and travel.
