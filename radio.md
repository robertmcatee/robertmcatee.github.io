# About
You can find me on, DMR TG 310217, DMR TG 31482, the AA5RO repeater system, or on 40 M CW.

TG 310217 (XLX410A) TalkGroup/310217 - BrandMeister (pd0zry.nl) - This talkgroup is tied to XLX410A, a dedicated reflector for the San Antonio Texas area. The idea of the reflector is to be a single place for all local repeaters and remote users to connect and stay in contact with friends and family no matter the digital mode. Visitors and residents alike are very welcome on the system. This talkgroup will be heard by D-Star users and System Fusion users so please avoid quick keying and allowing time between transmissions.
